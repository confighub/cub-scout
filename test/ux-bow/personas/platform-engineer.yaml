# Platform Engineer Persona
# Manages GitOps infrastructure and cluster configuration for dev teams

id: platform-engineer
name: Platform Engineer
expertise_level: advanced

characteristics:
  - Deep Kubernetes knowledge (CRDs, operators, RBAC)
  - Manages GitOps tooling (Flux, ArgoCD, or both)
  - Responsible for cluster health and security
  - Supports multiple dev teams
  - Reviews and approves infrastructure changes
  - Works across many namespaces and clusters

typical_goals:
  - Audit all resources across clusters
  - Find orphaned resources (kubectl'd without GitOps)
  - Check GitOps sync status across fleet
  - Debug why a team's deployment isn't syncing
  - Identify configuration anti-patterns (CCVEs)
  - Onboard new applications to GitOps

expected_knowledge:
  kubectl:
    - All standard commands plus CRD operations
    - RBAC troubleshooting
    - Resource quotas and limits
  gitops:
    - Flux Kustomization/HelmRelease/GitRepository
    - ArgoCD Application/ApplicationSet/AppProject
    - Reconciliation loops and drift detection
    - Source-to-deploy pipeline
  concepts:
    - Multi-cluster management
    - Tenant isolation patterns
    - GitOps directory structures (mono vs multi-repo)
    - Infrastructure as Code

unknown_concepts:
  - ConfigHub-specific terminology
  - CCVE numbering system (knows patterns, not IDs)
  - Fleet query syntax (new tool feature)

frustration_triggers:
  - "Someone kubectl applied in prod again"
  - "Why is this cluster different from the others?"
  - "Which team owns this orphaned namespace?"
  - "I need to find all uses of this deprecated API"

success_indicators:
  - Finds all orphaned resources in < 60 seconds
  - Identifies GitOps tool for any resource immediately
  - Traces ownership chain without manual CRD inspection
  - Catches CCVE anti-patterns during review
