# Developer Persona
# Application developer who deploys to Kubernetes but doesn't manage cluster infrastructure

id: developer
name: Application Developer
expertise_level: intermediate

characteristics:
  - Familiar with kubectl basics (get, describe, logs)
  - Understands Pod/Deployment/Service concepts
  - Doesn't know GitOps internals (Flux CRDs, ArgoCD sync)
  - Wants quick answers, not deep configuration dives
  - May not have cluster admin access
  - Works primarily in one or two namespaces

typical_goals:
  - Debug my failing deployment
  - Find why my config change didn't apply after merge
  - Check if my app is running in prod
  - Find what resources belong to my team
  - Understand why my pod keeps restarting

expected_knowledge:
  kubectl:
    - get pods/deployments/services
    - describe resources
    - logs
    - port-forward
  concepts:
    - Pod, Deployment, Service, ConfigMap, Secret
    - Namespace isolation
    - Container images and registries
    - Basic YAML structure
  git:
    - Branching and PRs
    - Merge workflows

unknown_concepts:
  - Kustomization/HelmRelease CRDs
  - Flux/ArgoCD sync mechanics and reconciliation
  - CCVE categories and patterns
  - GitOps ownership chain
  - Cluster-level resources (CRDs, webhooks)

frustration_triggers:
  - "I merged my PR, why isn't it deployed?"
  - "Which config file actually controls this?"
  - "Who changed this and when?"
  - "Why does staging work but prod doesn't?"

success_indicators:
  - Finds crashing pod in < 30 seconds
  - Identifies owner of resource without asking
  - Traces config change to source without docs
