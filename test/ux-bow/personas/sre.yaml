characteristics:
  - On-call for production incidents
  - Needs fast answers during outages
  - Monitors multiple clusters simultaneously
  - Cares about blast radius and rollback
  - Uses runbooks and playbooks
  - Time-pressured during incidents

typical_goals:
  - Find what changed before this incident started
  - Identify blast radius of a failing component
  - Quick rollback to known-good state
  - Find all affected services in an outage
  - Check health across fleet during incident
  - Post-incident audit of configuration drift

expected_knowledge:
  kubectl:
    - All standard commands
    - Quick resource inspection
    - Rollout undo/history
  operations:
    - Incident response procedures
    - Rollback strategies
    - Health check patterns
    - Alerting and monitoring
  gitops:
    - Basic sync status checking
    - Rollback via git revert
    - Force reconciliation

unknown_concepts:
  - Deep GitOps CRD internals

  - Finds ownership chain during incident (not after)
  - Initiates rollback from TUI without leaving context
