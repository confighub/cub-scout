personas:
  - sre                # Primary - "morning check"
  - platform-engineer  # Primary - "cross-cluster status"
  - developer          # Secondary - "my apps healthy?"

  cluster: any

goals:
  - See overall health status in < 5 seconds
  - Identify any critical issues immediately

  speed:
    tui: 5  # Instant - it's the default
    cli: 4  # Need to type command
    hub: 5  # Instant - it's the default
  consistency:
    tui: 5  # Status is always first
    cli: 5  # Map always shows status
    hub: 5  # Hierarchy always shows overview
  recovery:
    tui: 5  # N/A - it's the start
    cli: 5  # N/A - it's the start
    hub: 5  # N/A - it's the start
  delight:
    tui: 5  # Health bars, color coding, clean layout
    cli: 4  # Clean but less visual
    hub: 5  # Fleet context, hierarchy navigation

composite_scores:
  tui: 5.0    # Perfect
  cli: 4.6    # Excellent
  hub: 5.0    # Perfect

notes: |
  All entry points excel because this IS the primary use case.
  Default views are designed for "what's my status" question.
  CLI loses slightly on delight because less visual.
